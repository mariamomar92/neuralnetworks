Back-Propagation learning algorithm on a multi-layer neural networks, which is be able to classify a stream of input data to one of a set of predefined classes.
using penguins data in both the training and testing processes. (Each class has 50 samples: trained NN with the first 30 non-repeated samples, and tested it with the remaining 20 samples)
